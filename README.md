CODE MASTERS

Problem Stament:

Problem Statement:

"Building an Interactive and Scalable Online Coding Platform for Collaborative Learning and Problem-Solving"

Overview:
The project aims to develop a serverless coding platform that enables users to write, compile, and test code in real time. The platform will provide an interactive coding environment where users can solve coding problems, track progress, and participate in challenges. It will be built using React.js for the frontend, Firebase as the backend, and a serverless architecture for scalability and cost efficiency.

Challenges to Address:
Real-Time Code Execution: Implement a seamless experience for users to write and run code without delays.

User Authentication & Data Storage: Secure user login and save progress using Firebase Authentication and Firestore.

Collaborative Coding: Enable real-time collaboration where multiple users can edit and debug code together.

Scalability & Performance: Ensure smooth execution of code even with multiple users accessing the platform simultaneously.

Problem-Solving & Challenges: Provide a structured set of coding problems with varying difficulty levels and track user performance.

Leaderboard & Gamification: Encourage participation through points, badges, and leaderboards to motivate users.

Project Description: Interactive Serverless Coding Platform
Introduction
In today's digital age, online coding platforms play a crucial role in improving programming skills, preparing for coding interviews, and fostering collaborative learning. However, existing solutions often require complex server-side infrastructure, making them costly and difficult to scale.

Our project aims to build a serverless, real-time coding platform that allows users to write, compile, and test code seamlessly. The platform will provide an interactive environment where users can solve coding problems, collaborate with peers, and track their progress.
